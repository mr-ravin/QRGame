# QRGame
QRGame is a minimalist, terminal-based typing game where the player must quickly type a displayed key and press Enter before time runs out. As players advance, the time to respond shortens, pushing speed and accuracy to the limit. A single mistake ends the game, keeping the tension high as the challenge intensifies. True to its name, QRGame can be stored entirely within a simple QR code, making it easy to share and quick to start!"
